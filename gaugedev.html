<p>&nbsp;</p>IN PROGRESS
<p>I am currently developing a <b>programmatically generated</b> gauge in pure HTML-5. 
I am not even using PHP, but pure HTML-5, Jquery and Javascript.</p>

Almost every team in a modern large company has monthly and yearly goals which are expressed in K.P.I. s Key Performance Indicatos
A KPI is one number which expresses a key indicator of the team

For example ASA - Average Speed of Answer shows which percentage of the calls have been answered correctly before
the caller has been 30 seconds waiting on the line.

For example 85% of the calls can be answered before 30 seconds have passed and on 15% of the rest of the calls the user had to wait longer

In the companies there are a number of KPIs . Measuring KPIs is not difficult as in todays times the employees normally 
are working already on the computer. The idea is just to take those results and visualize them in realtime

There is supposed to be a visually clearly differentiated gauge for each KPI

Depending on the circumstances the scale can be adjusted


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In computer games, there are 3D generated computer models which </p>
<p>in some way are more advanced, but they require a 3D engine of the game 
installed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gauge which I am creating runs natively WITHOUT Flash in any browser 
without any plugins or separate installations. The user just needs his browser</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please use only Firefox for this time of development</p>

<br />
<a href="manual8.html">Launch Guage currently in development</a>
Please press the function keys "F11" for fullscreen and then "F5" for reload in firefox

<br />
<p>I am creating a collection of graphical elements which can be combined to 
create different gauges. It is possible to switch the background the pointer, 
etc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most importantly it is possible to switch the scale (from 0 to 100 or from 
-30 to +47, whatever you want</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also chose which graphical markers, how many of them, their starting 
position, etc. (please see the following pictures)</p>
&nbsp;<p><img alt="" height="647" src="samplePics/algo.PNG" width="732" /></p>
<p>This picture shows the positioning algorithm used to place the graphical markers and the numbers exactly in their place</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is one of the earlier development stages. It contains a company logo. 
The scale is customized from 0 to 500 and the markers are only on the left side</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changing only 1 parameter the ticks can be rearranged</p>
<p>The picture is computer generated and not manually made in photoshop</p>
